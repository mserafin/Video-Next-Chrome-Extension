# Video Next Chrome Extension

The application allows you to scroll through the currently playing video from the context menu, for example, to scroll through ads placed in front of the video.

The extension to the browser was created as a result of a temporary nervous breakdown in the number of advertisements in a well-known information service. The portal with VOD materials detected Adblock and other such popular programs. That's why I decided to write my own more effective solution. The project is at an early stage of development, if it will enjoy the interest of recipients, it will be developed further.

Works only in HTML5 Video.
